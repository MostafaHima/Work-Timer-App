# Work Timer App

This is a simple work timer application built using `Tkinter` for Python. The app helps users follow the Pomodoro Technique, which alternates between work and breaks.

## Features:
- **Timer**: The timer starts counting down for the work session (default is 10 minutes).
- **Short Break**: After each work session, the app provides a 5-minute short break.
- **Long Break**: After every 4 work sessions, a 20-minute long break is provided.
- **Start/Reset Buttons**: Start the timer or reset it to the initial state.
- **Checkmarks**: Every time a work session is completed, a checkmark ("âœ”") appears, helping track progress.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Use:
1. Click on the "Start" button to begin a work session.
2. The timer will automatically switch between work sessions and breaks.
3. Click on the "Reset" button to reset the timer at any time.
4. You can track your completed work sessions with the checkmarks.

## Installation:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.
2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
